# About Flickr Search 

Single page app implemented using a HTML5 (FlexBox), CSS3, JavaScripts. Jquery along with the Json features are being utilized to fetch results from Flickr Api. 

More advanced featured can be acheived by using the require.js 

## Usage

The interface is simple just type the keywords and then press the submit button. Make sure you are connected to internet during search. I have placed the comments on the recessary codes. 

## Coding Style

Its my habbit of writing css script place at the top and javascripts at the bottom just before the </body> tag. 

## How to delopy

If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository the command you need is git clone [url]. 


## Furthur Enhancement
